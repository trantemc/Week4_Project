The submitted script 'run.analysis.R' completes the goals of the assignment though the following general steps:

1) Data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzipped into a parent folder titled UCI.HAR.Dataset

2) All of the data files (6 total), along with feature names and activity labels, were then imported using the read.table function

3) Proper column names were assigned to each of the imported datasets as needed

4) The train and test data were merged independently using cbind and the resulting two data sets were merged into a final data set (All.Data) using rbind
   
5) All.Data was then pared down to only the columns of SubjectID, ActivityID, and those containing mean or standard deviation (std) measurements

6) The ActivityIDs were then swapped out for more descriptive Activity Labels for easier interpretation.
    * gsub was also used to apply descriptive activity names in all columns across the data set

7) The final tidy data of means was then created as an aggregate of All.Data by Subject and Activiy ID.
    * This final resulting data frame was exported as a text file using the write.table function and is included in this repository.
